## Working Explanation

- **IR Sensor 1** is placed **before the gate** to detect a **train approaching**.
- When **IR Sensor 1** detects the train:
  - The **servo motor rotates** to **close the gate**.
  - The **red LED** turns ON.
  - The **buzzer** activates to alert nearby vehicles and pedestrians.
 
    ---


- The train continues and reaches **IR Sensor 2**, which is placed **after the gate**.
- When **IR Sensor 2** detects the train has passed:
  - The **servo motor rotates again** to **open the gate**.
  - The **green LED** turns ON.
  - The **buzzer** stops.

> This process ensures that the gate is closed only when necessary and reopened safely once the train has completely crossed.
